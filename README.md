# VRChatCGinc

Third-party public domain VRChat.cginc for shader functionality explicit to VRChat.

Feel free to open any pull requests to add or update the contents of this. 

Only rule is, this should be for only the most absolute generic functionality that is explicit to VRChat. The intent is to create an include file that would be worthy of including in every VRChat shader. Then to also keep those implementations up to date in a central location.
